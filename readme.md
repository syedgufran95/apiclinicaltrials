#Api For ClinicalTrial Data <br><br>
We defined five endpoints in our API using python flask and request modules<br>
1: Endpoint 1 was created to convert XML files to a single CSV.<br>
2: Endpoint 2  was created to upload an XML file from the source to the destination on<br> 
   the local machine
3. Endpoint 3 was created to append uploaded files to an already created CSV.<br>
4. Endpoint 4 was created to parse the file. It can take arguments and return those specified<br>
   fields or can return all the field if no argument is supplied
5. Endpoint 5 was created to find the nct_id and return its information.<br>
